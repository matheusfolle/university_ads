## ðŸš€ Why this repo exists

While going through university, I realized that the best way to truly learn was to revisit the assignments â€” not just to improve the code, but to deepen the concepts behind them.

This repository reflects:
- My **growth** from semester to semester
- My commitment to writing **better, cleaner code**
- My willingness to **learn by doing** â€” again, and again

Feel free to explore the folders and follow my learning path â€“ one project at a time.
